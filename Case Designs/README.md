# FABI - case designs

This folder contains different types of case designs for the FABI or its buttons.
By now, all of them are designed for acrylic glass production with a laser cutter.
For compatibility reasons, they are all saved in the Corel Draw X5 format.
If not stated otherwise, the material is a 250mmx250mm acrylic glass (3mm thickness).

### 6buttons.cdr

This design contains 2 boards, each with 6 buttons (30mm hole).
They can be used as a full mouse replacement with the FABI interface.
Mounting is possible via the centre hole, fitting a 3/8" mount (used for photographic equipment)

### Button_30mm.cdr

This design is a simple button housing as a show case.
Very good to demonstrate the easy assembling of buttons for the FABI interface.

### stand-up_display.cdr

The stand-up display file contains one part with 6 buttons. The acrylic glass board should be bent with hot air support (angle: approx. 90Â°), to get a self-standing FABI display for show cases.
